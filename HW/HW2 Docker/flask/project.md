Agile Section
Theme:
Get GiggleGit demo into a stable enough alpha to start onboarding some adventurous clients.

Epic:
Onboarding experience.

User Stories:
1️. As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to quickly understand its unique features so that I can decide if it’s useful for my workflow.

Task: Provide clear onboarding documentation.
Ticket 1: Write "Getting Started" documentation.
Create a markdown-based guide covering installation, initial setup, and key features.
Ticket 2: Implement guided CLI tour.
Develop an interactive command-line guide that introduces users to basic GiggleGit functionalities.
2️. As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to monitor my team’s learning progress so that I can ensure they are effectively using the tool.

Task: Implement an analytics dashboard.
Ticket 1: Track onboarding progress.
Develop a system to log onboarding steps completed by users.
Ticket 2: Create a progress report feature.
Generate automated reports summarizing the onboarding progress of team members.
3️. As a developer working with a large team, I want to integrate GiggleGit with my existing workflows so that I can continue using my preferred tools without disruption.

Task: Provide integration support for existing git repositories.
Ticket 1: Implement compatibility mode for git-based workflows.
Ensure that GiggleGit can operate alongside vanilla Git repositories.
Ticket 2: Add configuration options for custom merge policies.
Allow teams to define and apply custom meme-based merge rules.
Formal Requirements Section
Project: SnickerSync Diff Tool
Goal:
Create an intuitive, engaging, and effective diff tool that enhances version control by integrating humorous and context-aware snickering interactions.

Non-Goal:
Developing a real-time collaborative editing feature. (SnickerSync focuses on diffs and merges, not live co-editing.)

Non-Functional Requirements:
1️. Security & Access Control
SnickerSync must enforce appropriate user access to ensure that sensitive code and merge decisions are protected.

Functional Requirement 1:
Only authorized users can approve and apply SnickerSync diffs.
Functional Requirement 2:
Users can set permission levels for viewing and applying SnickerSync diffs.
2️ User Study & Randomized Testing
To assess usability, SnickerSync must support randomized user assignments for A/B testing in user studies.

Functional Requirement 1:
Users should be automatically assigned to control or experimental groups for testing different snickering variations.
Functional Requirement 2:
SnickerSync should log and track interactions for usability studies, ensuring anonymized data collection.
